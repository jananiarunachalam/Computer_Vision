# Multitask Deep Learning


## Objective 

Design and train a multitask deep learning model in fastai & pytorch to solve 3 different problems simultaneously: classification, detection, and segmentation. 

## Data
The "bbc-1k" dataset is used, which contains 1000 images of bricks, balls, and cylinders against cluttered backgrounds. You can download the dataset [here](http://www.welchlabs.io/unccv/deep_learning/bbc_train.zip).
