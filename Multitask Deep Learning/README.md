# Multitask Deep Learning


## Objective 

Design and train a multitask deep learning model in fastai & pytorch to solve 3 different problems simultaneously: classification, detection, and segmentation. 

## Data
The "bbc-1k" dataset is used, which contains 1000 images of bricks, balls, and cylinders against cluttered backgrounds. You can download the dataset [here](http://www.welchlabs.io/unccv/deep_learning/bbc_train.zip)

## Packages
<ul>
<li>numpy
<li>opencv
<li>tdqm
<li>time
<li>pytorch
<li>fastai
<li>opencv
<li>scipy
</ul>

## Steps
1. Run blob_detection.py file using the command ```python blob_detection.py```.
2. Run evaluate.py file using the command ```python evaluate.py```.
